# ramen

ramen (ラーメン) is a windowing library primarily designed for
use in game engines and similar performance-critical real-time applications.
It is also intended to act as a reference for implementations of graphics windowing
in other languages, and attempts to document otherwise poorly or plain undocumented native APIs.
